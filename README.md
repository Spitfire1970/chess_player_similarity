- the inference endpoint has three main endpoints defined by the dictionary in the class constructor.
- all requests sent should be of the form {"inputs": data} where the data is another JSON/dictionary/js object.
- the data must be of the form {"num_endpoint": int} where int is:
                            , 0 (for testing endpoint),
                            , 1 for creating user
                            , 2 for the model's move
- to create user embeddings, specify additional fields in data:
                            , "username" : chess.com username,
                            , "pgn_content": a sinlge pgn consisting of multiple games played by the user.
                            , "games_per_player": specify how many games in the pgn file
- to get an ai_move, specify additional fields in data:
                            , "pgn_string" : pgn of game so far,
                            , "color": "white" if model is playing with white pieces else "black"
                            , "player_centroid": player_centroid as python list generated by endpoint 1
- the pytorch model definitions are in the encoder folder and the model weights in the *.pt file(s).
